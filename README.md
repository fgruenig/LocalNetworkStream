# LocalNetworkStream

The idea of this project is to Stream/Broadcast audio over a local network connection using WebRTC technology.
Using WebRTC ensures that the clients, who will be listening, do not need to install any software. 
It will just be supported by all devices, since all mainstream Browsers incorporate the technology.

For this code to work the network needs a node.js Server, a device with a microphone and as many clients as needed.
